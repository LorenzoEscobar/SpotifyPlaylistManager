# SpotifyPlaylistManager

This playlist manager lets you login using your spotify creditials, displays your playlists and lets you choose two to swap or move songs from. You can also hover over a song in your playlist to quickly listen to it. This tool lets you quickly visualize your songs in your playlists and reorganize them with a simple UI.
