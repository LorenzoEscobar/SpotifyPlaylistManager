# SpotifyPlaylistManager

This playlist manager lets you login using your spotify credentials, displays your playlists and lets you choose two playlists to swap or move songs from. 
You can also hover over a song in your playlist to quickly listen to it. This tool lets you quickly visualize your songs in your playlists and reorganize them with a simple drag and drop UI. 










## Contact LE.LorenzoEscobar@gmail.com for any assistance or questions! I can also whitelist you and you may use my server instead of hosting locally.
